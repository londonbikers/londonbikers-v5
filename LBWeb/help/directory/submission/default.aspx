	    We've tried to make it straight-forward to add an item to the Directory, in theory anybody can do it, who's a member. 
	    What we need from you is information about the item, i.e. name, contact information, description and any links or 
	    images to better describe the item.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    When submitting your item, please check it for spelling and factual correctness. We will do our best to correct any 
	    problems when we inspect your submission, but it helps speed things up for us. If you have any further questions, 
	    please <a href="mailto:contact@londonbikers.com" class="Flat">contact us</a>.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <a name="name"></a>
	    <h2 class="mb10">Name</h2>
	    Put the full, and abbreviated name of the item here, i.e. "Auto Cycle Union (ACU)". This will be used when a user is 
	    searching for an item, so it helps to have it descriptive.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <a name="telephone"></a>
	    <h2 class="mb10">Telephone</h2>
	    Please put the full telephone number, including the area code, if applicable, i.e. 01324 246 1224. Giving users more 
	    ways to contact you will increase the chances of them doing so.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <a name="description"></a>
	    <h2 class="mb10">Description</h2>
	    You can put a full description of your item here. There is no limit, but we believe three to four paragraphs is about 
	    the maximum that's useful to the user. Try to make it descriptive of your item and entice the user to your site, or 
	    to contact you. Please note that any text put here is subject to our approval and may be edited to meet our publishing 
	    guidelines. Only text is permitted, any HTML will be removed.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <a name="keywords"></a>
	    <h2 class="mb10">Keywords</h2>
	    By putting in a string of keywords that describe the nature of your item, seperated by commas, you will help the LB 
	    site allow users to find your item by concept, i.e. if you are a Piaggio dealer, putting in keywords along the lines 
	    of 'scooters, mopeds, sales, chelsea' will allow people to find what they are looking for, without actually entering 
	    your organisation/business name. Keywords are used directly by the 'concept' search option.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    It's our job to ensure the keywords that go into the Directory match with other similar keywords, so don't worry too 
	    much about keywords if you're unsure, as we will put in our own keywords to ensure your item can be found easily.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <a name="links"></a>
	    <h2 class="mb10">Links</h2>
	    You are able to add multiple links to other sites to your item submission. If your organisation or company has more 
	    than one website, or there's more than one page on your site that relates to the item, feel free to enter them here. 
	    To enter links, type the full address of the site/page into the textbox and click the 'add' button. The link will be 
	    added to a list for you to see.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    You can test any links you enter for correctness by clicking on them when they show in the list after entering them. 
	    Please do this, as it's easy to make a mistake and enter an incorrect link.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <a name="images"></a>
	    <h2 class="mb10">Images</h2>
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    Images can be added to your item to bring it alive and show the user exactly what you're advertising. Images could be 
	    of your organisation/company logo, an activity, or nearly anything else, as long as it's not insulting, explicit, 
	    racially offensive or deflamatory. Any number of images can added, though we think two or three is about right.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    Due to the size of the Directory, we can't host the images for you, so if you want to include images 
	    in your submission, you need to ensure they are already hosted on the web, i.e. already on your website. We believe 
	    images should be no more than 500 pixels wide, by 500 tall. If you are unsure what this means, then it can be 
	    described as a small to medium sized image. If you are unsure, include it anyhow and if it's too big, we will remove 
	    it from the submission.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    To add an image, you need to enter the full address of where the image is on the web, into the textbox and click the 
	    'add' button. Once added, it will show in a list, where you can remove it, if need be. If you are unsure how to get 
	    the address of the image, you can do one of the following:
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <h4>
		    Using Internet Explorer:
	    </h4>
	    <br />
	    First, right-click on the image to use, and select 'properties'.
	    <br />
	    <div style="padding: 7px; background-color: #EBECEE; width: 236px; margin-top: 10px;"><img src="/_images/content/ie-get-properties.png" /></div>
	    <br />
	    Then when the properties window shows, copy the address by selecting the entirity of the address, then right-click 
	    and select 'copy'.
	    <br />
	    <div style="padding: 7px; background-color: #EBECEE; width: 358px; margin-top: 10px;"><img src="/_images/content/ie-copy-address.png" /></div>
	    <br />
	    <h4>
		    Using Mozilla Firefox:
	    </h4>
	    <br />
	    Right-click on the image to use, and select 'copy image location'.
	    <br />
	    <div style="padding: 7px; background-color: #EBECEE; width: 274px; margin-top: 10px;"><img src="/_images/content/ff-copy-address.png" /></div>
	    <br />
	    When you've copied the address, you can paste (right click, paste) it into the item submission, image textbox, and click 'add'. If all 
	    went well, the image will show in the list.
	    <br />
